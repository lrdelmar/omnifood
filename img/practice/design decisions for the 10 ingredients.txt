design decisions for the 10 'ingredients' 
are based on the WEBSITE PERSONALITY

/*
SPACING SYSTEM ( #px)
2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 128

FONT SIZE SYSTEM ( #px )

#1 typography

serif vs sans-serif
serif has the tails/feet at the ends of letters
gives a traditional look, conveys trust, good for long text
sans-serif gives a modern feel, clean, simple, easier for beginner designers

only use good/popular typefaces, don't go for anything weird or crazy looking

it's okay to use 1 font, 2 max

think about the personality of the website and choose a sans-serif or serif font. experiment with all 'good' fonts and try different fonts as you build the website

FONT SIZES - limit your choices
normal text - between 16-32px
headlines - 50px+ and bold 600+
DON'T use font weight 400 or less

READING EXPERIENCE
between 65 and 75 char per line
line-height for normal text between 1.5 and 2 - the smaller or longer the text, the larger the height
try decreasing the letter-spacing if it looks unnatural
experiment with all caps for short titles - small and bold, increase letter-spacing
usually, don't justify text, don't center larger blocks of text either

#2 colours
red - draws the most attention, power, passion, excitement

orange - less aggressive, happiness, cheerfulness and creativity

yellow - joy, brightness and intelligence

USE A GOOD TONE
- open color
- tailwindcss
- flat ui colors 2

COLOUR SYSTEMS
main colour + grey colour + accent colour
eg. turquoise + deep dark blue + red tone

have a relationship between the main colour and others
have multiple shades of these colours (lighter and dark versions or "tints" and "shades")

tint & shade generator if choosing your own colours
- palleton.com
- coolors (https://coolors.co/0a122a-fbe137-a0acad)

use the MAIN colour to draw attention to the most important elements to the page - buttons

colours add interesting accents or make entire sections or components stand out

use colour strategically in images and illustrations

with dark coloured backgrounds, use a lighter tint of the same colour for the text

text should not be completely black but very dark shades of colours, softens black text

never make the text too light for accessibility reasons, have a decent contrast of at least 5:1 or greater

~~~~~~~~~~
#3 images/illustrations

product images - demonstrate the product you're selling
storytelling photos - convey the message of your website
illustrations - abstract storytelling, original, character
patterns - as a background, behind images to add interest, visual detail

stock image websites:
-unsplash
-pexels
-drawkit
-undraw

show real people to trigger emotion
crop images to fit your message
combine photos, illustrations and patterns

text on images:
darken or brighten the image
use a gradient to darken some of the image
position the text into a neutral area in the image
put the text in a box


account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size - if you want the image to be 300x300 on the website, make the original image 600x600 - if you dont do this the image will appear blurry on a high-res screen

compress images for a lower file size and load performance
use SQUOOSH to compress images for a smaller file size
when using multiple images side by side must have the same dimensions or aspect ratio

~~~~~~~~~~
#4 icons

use a good icon pack and not random icons
free or emojis - don't mix icon packs
- phosphor icons
- ionicons
- icons8
- heroicons

use svg icons or icon fonts (not bitmap, jpg or png)

use a similar roundness and weight to your websites personality and typography

use icons to provide visual assistance to text
build feature blocks - icon at the top, heading and description
can be combined with actions
can use them as bullet points
keep icons neutral, same colour as text
or
different colours to draw attention
icons should make sense, fit the text or action
do not make the icons larger than they were designed for, find icons that are the right size for their use

COLOURING SVGS - solid use the fill property and for outline use the stroke property

~~~~~~~~~~
#5 shadows

shadows are used to bring an element forward, off the flat page, don't just use them anywhere and only if it matches the website personality

use light shadows (rgba)

small shadows for small elements 

medium shadows for larger areas to make them stand out

large shadows for elements to float above the webpage like a pop-up or a menu

experiment with shadows on link and button elements, hover with a shadow and then remove the shadow when active to give the feeling of the button 'clicking'

can use colour shadows to make elements glow


~~~~~~~~~~
#6 border-radius

increases the playfulness, more radius more fun, less radius is serious

match the typeface, less radius for blocky square fonts and more radius for rounded fonts

can use on buttons, images, icons and larger elements like boxes

best to use a value that is larger than the height of the element if you want to guarantee fully rounded edges

~~~~~~~~~~
#7 whitespace

without it websites look cluttered

creates a clean, modern and polished look
communicates how different pieces are related and creates a hierarchy
implies invisble relationships between elements

use loads of whitespace between sections eg 100-200px
more vertical space is needed than horizontal space
use whitespace between elements
use whitespace instead of line breaks

related or grouped elements should be closer together

start with too much whitespace and then reduce it as needed - too much looks detached and not enough looks cramped

match other design choices - big text or big icons need more white space

try a hard rule - using multiples of 16px for all spacing

~~~~~~~~~~
#8 visual hierarchy

establishes which elements on the page are the most important ones

draws attention to the most important elements

helps to define a path for users, to guide them through the page

this can be done using a combination of position, size, colours, spacing, borders and shadows

- position important elements to the top of the page, elements that appear first will get more attention
- use images mindfully, they draw a lot of attention
- use whitespace strategically to emphasise elements
- use a combo of font size, weight, colour and whitespace to give different levels of importance e.g. lighter colours for less important text or bolder bigger text for more importance
- emphasise - titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons
- de-emphasise - labels, secondary information

between components - background colours, shadows or borders
to make an element more important, try de-emphasising it's secondary element
which components ? 
testimonials, call-to-action, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns
